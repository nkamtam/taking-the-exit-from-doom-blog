According to the National Alliance of Mental Illness (NAMI), one in five American experience mental health issues which translates to more than 40 million adults a year.\n\n<center><bold>WHY IS MENTAL HEALTH IMPORTANT?</bold></center>\n\nEmotional and mental health is important because it impacts your thoughts, behaviors and emotions. Being healthy emotionally can promote productivity and effectiveness in activities like work, school or caregiving. It plays an important part in the health of your relationships, and allows you to adapt to changes in your life and cope with adversity.\n\n```{r load-packages-data, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\ndf_raw <- read_csv(\"./Ginzberg_depression.csv\")\ndf <- df_raw[,-1] #delete ID column\n```\n\n<center>Data Source: http://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/datasets.html</center>\n\n```{r glimpse, echo=FALSE}\nglimpse(df)\n\n```\n\n```{r plot-1, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(df, aes(x = adjsimp, y = adjdep)) +\n    geom_point()\n\n```\n\nThis is the scatterplot of 'adjdep' vs. 'adjsimp' where 'adjsimp' is the Adjusted Simplicity: Simplicity adjusted (by regression) for other variables thought to influence depression and 'adjdep' is Adjusted Depression. We can clearly visualize that as a subject's need to see the world in black and white (adjusted) increases, the higher the adjusted depression level is.\n\nMetadata Details: http://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/carData/Ginzberg.html\n\nAccording to https://www.statnews.com/2017/05/31/mental-health-medicine/ :\n\n\nMental disorders affect nearly 20 percent of American adults; nearly 4 percent are severely impaired and classified as having serious mental illness. <img style=\"float: left;\" src=\"/MentalHealthStigma.png\", width=\"500px\", height=\"300px\"> These disorders are often associated with chronic physical illnesses such as heart disease and diabetes. They also increase the risk of physical injury and death through accidents, violence, and suicide.\n\nMental illnesses affect 19% of the adult population, 46% of teenagers and 13% of children each year. People struggling with their mental health may be in your family, live next door, teach your children, work in the next cubicle or sit in the same church pew.\n\nHowever, only half of those affected receive treatment, often because of the stigma attached to mental health. Untreated, mental illness can contribute to higher medical expenses, poorer performance at school and work, fewer employment opportunities and increased risk of suicide.\n\n\n\n\n\n```{r non-adj-plots, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = simplicity, y = depression)) +\n    geom_point()\n\n```\n\nWe can see that, similar to using adjusted values, as a subject's need to see the world in black and white increases, the higher their self-reported depression level is.\n\nAccording to https://www.nami.org/blogs/nami-blog/october-2017/9-ways-to-fight-mental-health-stigma :\n\nMost people who live with mental illness have, at some point, been blamed for their condition. They’ve been called names. Their symptoms have been referred to as “a phase” or something they can control “if they only tried.” They have been illegally discriminated against, with no justice. This is the unwieldy power that stigma holds.\n\nStigma causes people to feel ashamed for something that is out of their control. Worst of all, stigma prevents people from seeking the help they need. For a group of people who already carry such a heavy burden, stigma is an unacceptable addition to their pain. And while stigma has reduced in recent years, the pace of progress has not been quick enough.\n\n(Source: https://blog.doctorondemand.com/why-its-important-to-care-for-your-mental-health-834c8670b889)\n\n\n<img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"/main_image.jpg\", width=\"500px\", height=\"300px\">\n\n<bold>HOW CAN YOU IMPROVE YOUR EMOTIONAL HEALTH DAY-TO-DAY?</bold>\n\nThere are steps you can take to improve your mental health everyday.
